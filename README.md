## Upload Instructions

1. Make a new subfolder inside the SamplePacks folder. (Or, if the product is not a sample pack, make a new folder on the same level as SamplePacks first.) Name it the product name in PascalCase, no spaces.

2. Upload the .html files to the product folder. Please follow this naming convention: {product abbreviation}-{2-digit order of the instance as it appears on the page}-{dimensions}.html. So for example, a file named `DTS-01-1x4.html` would be the first Wavesurfer instance on the Drums That Sauce page. It would be 1 column wide and 4 rows long.
