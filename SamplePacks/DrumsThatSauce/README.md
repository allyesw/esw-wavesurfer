# Drums That Sauce Wavesurfer Files

## File Naming Conventions

Please follow this naming convention: {product abbreviation}-{2-digit order of the instance as it appears on the page}-{dimensions}.html.

So for example, a file named `DTS-01-1x4.html` would be the first Wavesurfer instance on the Drums That Sauce page. It would be 1 column wide and 4 rows long.
